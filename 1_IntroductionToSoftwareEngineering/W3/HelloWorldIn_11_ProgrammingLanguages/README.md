# Hands-on Lab : Hello World in 11 Programming Languages

A software design is abstract and needs to be given a tangible form by code. Code is created using programming languages or scripting languages. In this lab, you will see how most commonly used languages are means to get to the end and provide similar output. The way you write the program and run the code will differ from one language to another. A software engineer can be proficient in one or more languages. In this lab, you will begin your journey to become multilingual in computer programming by learning to say "Hello World!" in 10 popular languages: C, Java, Go, Python, Node JS, Ruby, PHP, PERL, Bash, C++, and a bonus markup language, HTML.
